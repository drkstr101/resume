# Resume - Aaron R Miller

This project contains all sources and public resources used in the publication of my personal resume,
and also serves as a self-contained code sample of my work. If you did not end up here by following
a link in my published resume, feel free to use this project as a guide for publishing your own
resume data in a variety of user-defined formats or representations.


## Project Goals

This project intends to provide a mechanism for publishing a complete portfolio that is able to provide
meaningful and objective insights over the sea of data points accumulated over time.
